# 1. Project Overview

## 1.1. Project Objective

The primary objective of the project is to showcase handcrafted furniture, customized specifically for each individual that is then made available for purchase. 

The user can browse the selection and then enquire about getting either there own piece made or select from some of the designs alreadly available. The user is left to feel uniquely targted opposed to just buying from any normal retailer.

The target audience are people with a keen eye for detail and appreciation for owning a one of kind artistic piece.

## 1.3. Design

The colours I chose to use where neutral off white's and charchoal grey's aswell as a bright vibrant red which pops out from the neutral theme.
I did this as I felt it provided a clean, minimalistic and contempory feel, whils't allowing the beauty of the products to take center stage.

When it came to typography the Poppins font is the main font I used throughout website.
Poppins is a clean font I see throughout web design and this is the primary reason I chose to use it
I combine this with Sans Serif, as I really enjoy the simplicty it has, not only that but in some case where the other font isn't being imported it will not detract from the integrity of the design. 

This minimalist approach was important as to give a proffesional apperance and the images used are a design statement themsleves.
I caught the users eye with a bold typogrpahic company logo aswell as grid style hero layout with images of the products which the user enages with instantly.

I saw this as good design choice as any potential customer will see what is offer as soon as the page loads.

## 3.5. Bugs and Fixes

Some bugs that were found and fixed:

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ------- | ------- |
| Products on product page kept stacking ontop of each other | This was caused by an open <div> tag which was then fixed by adding a closing </div> at the end of the container which then correctly aligned the items in a grid formation |
| Content was overflowing when shrunk down to mobile screen-size | Caused by overflow. This was fixed by adding overflow-x; to the body element in css which then allowed content to stay within the screen without a showing a horizontal scrollbar |
| About us image not loading | Caused by wrong file path. This was fixed by changing the file path to correctly follow the directory structure |
| Map not loading | This was due to a spaceing in the iframe code, this was corrected by removing tab and putting code across one line |
