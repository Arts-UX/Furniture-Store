## Design

The colours I chose to use where neutral off white's and charchoal grey's aswell as a bright vibrant red which pops out from the neutral theme.
I did this as I felt it provided a clean, minimalistic and contempory feel, whils't allowing the beauty of the products to take center stage.

When it came to typography the Poppins font is the main font I used throughout website.
Poppins is a clean font I see throughout web design and this is the primary reason I chose to use it
I combine this with Sans Serif, as I really enjoy the simplicty it has, not only that but in some case where the other font isn't being imported it will not detract from the integrity of the design. 

This minimalist approach was important as to give a proffesional apperance and the images used are a design statement themsleves.
I caught the users eye with a bold typogrpahic company logo aswell as grid style hero layout with images of the products which the user enages with instantly.

I saw this as good design choice as any potential customer will see what is offer as soon as the page loads.
